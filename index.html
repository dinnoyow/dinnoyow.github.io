                        <p>I'm an artist and developer interested in creating applications and games that have <b>value</b>. I'm inspired by and aspire to example <a href="https://www.valvesoftware.com" target="_blank">Valve's</a> philosophy at work.</p>
                        <p>I'm Indonesian, grew up in Indonesia, and I've finished my high school degree. I'm currently gaining more skills in art, security, and programming.</p>
                        <p>Besides academic studies, I've been self-taught in the pursuit of my interests, which gives me an important insight: There's always a way to make sense of anything, and what you need is to find your footing. Until you find it, curiosity is your teacher.</p>
                        <p>I love music, manga, motion pictures, and video games. My main goal is to create works that will leave marks on people's minds.</p>
                        <p><i>@dinnoyow</i> is a nickname I use for my internet-related activities and account usernames. It is used for anonymity.</p>

                        <h1 class="fw-bolder">Artificial Intelligence.</h1>
                        <p>Artifical intelligence in this section refers to the machine learning and data prediction programs, either from text, sound, image, or video.</p>
                        <div class="py-3"></div>

                        <h2>The Good.</h2>
                        <p>Artificial intelligence is a really good teacher. It can elaborate, simplify, and provide relatively concrete guidance on a well known general or specific topics, which is really helpful for studying efficiently.</p> 

                        <p>One of the hurdles of self-taught studying is shifting through the internet for answers. Often times, it requires 20 to 30 clicks to finally get a good enough picture for complicated topics. AI speeds up the process to 2 to 6 clicks for most topics.</p>  

                        <p>It helps identify and explain term confusions that is surprisingly common in a lot of study fields. It is capable to provide possible outcome(s) when given a scenario. Sometimes, it points out missing context, which is really helpful to understand concept that build on top of another concept. Certain models that provides citation links makes it easier to confirm the AI's response.</p>

                        <p>Overall, it is by far the best way to start getting into a new field of study.</p>

                        <h2>The Bad.</h2>
                        <p>At the current time of writing, <a href="https://www.iea.org/reports/electricity-2024/executive-summary" target="_blank">AI costs a considerable amount of energy</a>, prone to hallucinations on not-so-well-known topics, <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.10970" target="_blank">potentially causing AI psychosis</a>, legal and ownership issues regarding data training on copyrighted contents, as well as high incentive for AI adoption which leads to invasive technologies.</p>

                    <div>
                        <p>Content generating AIs are making it easy for misinformation to spread, ranging from deepfakes to text-video generation. Distinguishing what is real and fake is becoming difficult, which might cause photo, audio, or video evidences to be redundant in the near future.</p>

                        <p>The development of AI has been growing with a lack of regulation, thanks to the significant difference of speed between law implementation and AI growth.</p>
                        <div class="py-3"></div>

                        <h2>More Opinions.</h2>
                        <p>Personally, I think AI technology is being valued more than it should be. The cost of running one financially is currently at a loss, and its success at finally becoming profitable depends on the public image of AI, rather than its genuine value.</p>

                        <p>On programming, I think <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linus_Torvalds" target="_blank">Linus</a> said it best on <a href="https://youtu.be/tWx769t1JKg?t=1140" target="_blank">this video</a>. AI or vibe coding can be a gateway for new programmers to have easier access to learn and practice programming and computer science. It might not be productive for seasoned programmers due to their hallucination issues and heavier amount of debugging, but it's a really good guide for those who are new to the space.</p>

                        <p>I don't think AI Artists exists. The current AI arts are made by AI commissioners. Despite how they are proving that it requires technicality and expertise in using AI models, their workflow is more like commissioners that commissions various different AIs to generate or enhance specific parts of an AI generated picture. The artist is the AI, and the AI commissioners are just commissioning the AI.</p>

                    <div>
                        <h1 class="fw-bolder">Education.</h1>
                        <p>My education path hasn't been the most impressive, mainly finishing mandatory formal education and <a href="https://www.coursera.org/professional-certificates/google-cybersecurity/#courses">Google Cybersecurity Professional Course</a>. I've been self-taught in drawing, animating, and coding, but I do not have any degrees on related field of studies. Although I'm doing relatively fine academically, I have some gripes with common standard education system, which will be the topic for the rest of this section.</p>
                        <div class="py-3"></div>

                        <h2>General Structure of Current Education System.</h2>
                        <p>Before we begin, let's set a baseline.</p>
                        <p>In Indonesia, the standard mandatory education system are divided into several levels, these are called <i>"Kelas *"</i> with <i>*</i> being the advancement level. The advancement levels are divided into three categories. The elementary ranges from <i>Kelas</i> 1 to 6, middle school ranges from <i>Kelas</i> 7 to 9, and high school ranges from <i>Kelas</i> 10 to 12. A typical student progresses a <i>Kelas</i> every year. A student that failed can repeat a <i>Kelas</i>. The number of repeat allowed varies across schools.</p>

                        <p>When a person are not capable to follow the standard structure of the school system for any reason, they are given chances to enroll and gain standard education certificates, which are divided into three certificates based on the three categories mentioned. Those three certificates are <i>Paket</i> A, B, and C. <i>Paket</i> A refers to elementary-equivalent certificate, <i>Paket</i> C refers to highschool-equivalent certificate.</p>

                        <p>Standard mandatory education system on other countries seems to follow a similar general structure.</p>
                        <div class="py-3"></div>

                        <h2>The Problem With Fixed Progression.</h2>
                        <p>The current system favors only those who are able to follow the progression. Students' brain development stages vary, the same goes to their comprehension capabilities of different subjects. Concepts always build on top of another. When a student fails to grasp a concept, it is guaranteed for them to fail the next concept that builds on top of it. The education system is not made to account for this.</p>

                        <p>This problem is hard to spot when students are still in their earlier grades. It is very easy to brush off when a student doesn't understand certain concepts, under a pretense that the system is trusting that students will understand it eventually in the future grades. It is also common for teachers to be overwhelmed by the amount of workload from grading papers, taking their focus from identifying students that requires attention into something that should be automated.</p>

                        <p>This problem eventually piles up into a large issue, where a student is expected to understand current concepts, when a lot of previous concepts are not understood.</p>

                        <p>Just because a student is failing to understand one concept at their earlier grades, the rest of their grades become compromised. It's almost like a soldier marching in a group lead by an ruthless leader. Once they stumble and fall, they got trampled and replaced.</p>

                        <p>Although this is an issue, it is also need to be known that a fixed progression provides benefits too. A constant progression forces a student to have a sense of urgency, which is needed when a student lacks the motivation to study. This might be the reason why this system remains the same.</p>
                        <div class="py-3"></div>

                        <h2>Punishment With Inconsistent Solution.</h2>
                        <p>A failure should be met by punishment. It's a good design when solution is imminent, but it becomes a horrifyingly bad design when a solution is not concluded. The solution we're talking about is a way to make sense of a concept that is currently being studied. Failure to meet solution happens when a student fails to understand the concept.</p>
                        
                        <p>The current state of education punishes by default, but fails to consistently provide solutions to the problem. By the time a problem is obvious, the problem becomes too big to be properly solved. The result of this is how the system makes it seems justified to shift the blame to students for not studying hard / being smart enough, further putting punishments without providing a solution that is realisticly achieveable. It is true that the student is also part of the problem, but it is false to say the system is not part of the problem.</p>

                    </div>
                    <div class="d-none d-md-block p-lg-5"></div>
                </div>
                <div class="col d-md-flex flex-md-row">
                    <div>

                        <p>Punishments have direct impact on student's psychology. Students decide what is worth their attention and what isn't. When a punishment is repeatedly being held without achieving solution, it's etching a message that a study is not worth the student's attention, because it is imprinted that studying means punishment. This leads to worsening effectiveness of study down the road.</p> 
                        
                        <p>When the student's general knowledge fails to meet public expectations, it has the potential to lower the student's self esteem. This is a dangerous pit to fall, because it has become a negative feedback loop within the student's mind. The student might follow the path of self loathing and pessimism, which has a potential to sabotage the student's life.</p>
                        <div class="py-3"></div>

                        <h2>Herd Mentality.</h2>
                        <p>Current education system creates a tight structure. Structure is good, but over reliance on it is bad. When a student is not comfortable to push through a field of study when there's no clear structure, it will create a mental block that stops growth. A forced, fixed, structured education system since childhood is deciding what the student's should accomplish, but it takes agency from the student, which impacts the student's decision making skills negatively. This problem can be clearly seen when most students finishes mandatory education program without certainty on what they should do next, even after the help from career counseling programs.</p>

                        <p>Depending on different people, this might be good or bad. The current education system creates someone that is willing to trust the process, willing to follow the predetermined workflow. However, this design is bad when it's eroding the student's critical thinking and self agency. In an event when there is no structure to follow, it might lead someone to confusion and decision paralysis. Even when a person has a general goal, they could still be confused on how to find, analyze, and prioritize what action should they take.</p>

                        <p>The problem with this is when a person is taking advantage of the herd mentality, and nobody questions it.</p>
                        <div class="py-3"></div>

                        <h2>An Attempt To Find Solutions.</h2>
                        <p>Reforming an education system is a complicated process, but it needs to start. The ideas I am putting here serves for that purpose, and I hope it will push more discussions for those who read it.</p>

                        <p>The goal of an education system is to provide students an ease of access and learning facilities to advance their skills and knowledge. A level of general education is needed, but I believe the students needs to be taught how to make choices, especially how to consider the risks, how to research for risks, and how to live with their choices, as well as learning to be responsible of their choices. These are important for the students as their fundamentals, to enforce that they are the main driver of their own life. What comes next should be facilities that helps them answer their curiosity. However, this approach relies on the student's willingness to study. I believe that if they are provided a strong fundamentals on life, they will have their own shields and engine. But at the end of the day, it's a belief, and it needs to be proven in order to gauge its actual effectiveness.</p>
                        <div class="py-3"></div>

                        <h2>More Opinions.</h2>
                        <p>The three main gripes that I have with the current system is a deadly combination that would cost generation their livelihoods. As a summary, the education system progresses constantly, despite the shortcomings that a student might face. As a result, the students that fail to understand a concept will fail to understand the following concepts which builds on top of it. Students are faced with punishments, but not all students are consistently given solutions. This cycle repeats, causing the problem to root deeper, and creates students that are not ready for societal expectations, which potentially could sabotage the student's future.</p>

                        <p>The reason why this education section is really long comes from how many pointless stress, depression, and deaths that the education system has directly or indirectly claimed, and I can't help but think that it might be time for the system works to be reformed, for the better.</p>

                        <p>The education system is like a building. Just like an architect and engineer designs and builds a building, it can cost people their lives when they are not designed well.</p>

                        <p>This section has not included the culture that it creates and the impacts on families and society as a whole due to it being an even bigger issue that can be discussed in much lengthier detail.</p>

                    <p>This painting is made for the purpose of box-brush painting as well as using the <a href="https://www.artstation.com/learning/series/E5/practical-composition">abstract environment approach</a>. The color pallete and shape design is influenced by the game <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/312520/Rain_World/">Rain World</a>. To me, this piece feels "windy quiet". I am really proud of how this painting turned out. I really love how each shapes fall into the right place. It's nice.</p>

                    <p>This painting is meant to be the opposite in tone of the previous piece. The warmth is flipped to cold, making it quiet but under pressure. The big figure in the background is inspired by <a href="https://evangelion.fandom.com/wiki/Evangelion">evangelion humanoid robot</a>. I was rewatching the movies at this time. Just like the previous art, I'm implementing abstract environment as a way to come up with composition.</p>

Sometimes there are subtle things in askziye's art style that makes the art piece unqiue to them. Perhaps the lighting, the shape design, the details. I'm planning to return to this.</p>
